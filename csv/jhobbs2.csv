/Midterm 1/Review,Gauss Law Review - Conductor-Insulator (part a),Starting a Gauss Law problem with conductor and insulator: the conducting and insulating object is defined and field regions 1-5 (I-V) are labelled and explained.,https://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/vq/themmick/144/,3:44:00,13,0,1,4,,M1,,Review
/Midterm 1/Review,Gauss Law Review - Conductor-Insulator (part b),"Here, we determine the electric field for the ""easy"" regions of the object: Completely outside, between the insulator and conductor, within the conductor, and inside the conductor around the point charge.",https://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/vq/themmick/145/,2:56:00,13,0,1,4,,M1,,Review
/Midterm 1/Review,Gauss Law Review - Conductor-Insulator (part c),"We examine the electric field within the insulator, using our Gauss Law symmetries rule. We define our area as well as what the Q_in would be, remembering that we have charge distributed within the volume of the insulator too.",https://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/vq/themmick/146/,10:29:00,13,0,1,4,,M1,,Review
/Midterm 1/Review,Gauss Law Review - Conductor-Insulator (part d),"Now, we write the final electric field for the insulator region (region 2), and plot the electric field for regions 1-5 as a function of radius. Prof. Hemmick reviews the important points of this particular Gauss Law system.",https://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/vq/themmick/147/,11:04:00,13,0,1,4,,M1,,Review
/Midterm 1/Review,Integrals Review - Partial Spherical Shell,"Prof. Hemmick reviews how to calculate the electric field via integration for a partial spherical shell, by breaking up the surface into point charges. Prof. Hemmick will select 1 of the 5 possible integrals for the exam. *NOTE* as the video cuts halfway through solving for the electric field integral, refer to the ""Integrals"" pdf in Review Materials, lines 101 to the end of the page.",https://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/vq/themmick/148/,7:41:00,13,0,1,4,,M1,,Review
/Midterm 2/Review,Review - Biot-Savart (part a),"Prof. Hemmick reviews how to get the magnetic field from a collection of currents, broken into infinitely many, infinitesimally small pieces which are summed over. ",https://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/vq/themmick/213/,4:14:00,23,0,2,8,,M2,,Review
/Midterm 2/Review,Review - Biot-Savart (part b),"Prof. Hemmick explains the ""cross s hat"" portion of Biot-Savart integral and how to solve, as well as reviews the right-hand rule to find magnetic field from current. ",https://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/vq/themmick/214/,8:13:00,23,6,2,8,,M2,,Review
/Midterm 2/Review,Review - More Magnetic Field Lines,"We examine our two currents connected as a ring of current with a radius a, and examine the surviving magnetic field at a point away from the ring, P.",https://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/vq/themmick/215/,8:58:00,23,0,2,8,,M2,,Review
/Midterm 2/Review,"Review - Solving ""Cross S Hat""","In order to build our Biot-Savart integral for the ring of current, we must use what we've reviewed to calculate the surviving direction of our magnetic field.",https://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/vq/themmick/216/,8:57:00,23,0,2,8,,M2,,Review
/Midterm 2/Review,Review - An Easier Biot-Savart Problem,"Prof. Hemmick goes over an easier Biot-Savart, which we can outsmart by thinking which magnetic fields cancel.",https://apps.tlt.stonybrook.edu/vq/themmick/217/,5:51:00,23,1,2,8,,M2,36:13:00,Review
